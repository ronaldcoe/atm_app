# Overview
My first encounter with Object Oriented Programming was in Python, and although it seemed confusing at the begginig, I was able to have an understanding its concepts, at least in a theorical sense. Java is all about classes, and building this small app using this new language (new for me because is my first time using Java) helped me to deepen my understanding of OOP that I learned in Python. My purpose for writing this program is learning the bascis of Java. The language syntax is easy to learn, and the language seems very robust with an ever growing library for programmers to use.

This application make uses of loops, classes, objects, conditional statements, input and output, and functions. It allows the user to create an account, check his balance, make deposits, and withdraw money.
